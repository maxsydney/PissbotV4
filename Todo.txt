- D-term filtering                                                              - Partially complete
- I-term engage only once still is up to temperature                            
- Record current process data in RAM                
- Write drivers for flowrate sensors                                            - Partially complete
- Include Feedforward control 
- Configurable minimum pump speeds
- Install flowmeters
- Calibrate flow meter
- Add process phase tracking
- Scan for new sensors without restarting       
- serialize/deserialize virtual methods on MessageBase
- Deserialize doesn't init uninitialized MessageBase
- Queue operations are not atomic and could cause concurrency problems
- Implement heap monitoring in distillerManager
- Implement handling for failure modes
